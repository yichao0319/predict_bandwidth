## 
The program includes two parts:
1. parser:    parse tcpdump and generate throughput timeseries
2. predictor: use EWMA/Holt-Winters to predict traffic



##########
## tcpdump
tcpdump -i en3 -w tcpdump.campus.walking.tcp.dat tcp


##########
## Wei's trace
The traces are at /v/filer4b/v27q002/ut-wireless/wdong/mobile_trace

The raw traces are walking.pcap, shuttle.pcap and static.pcap

The throughput per 5 seconds files are walking_throughput_5.txt,
shuttle_throughput_5.txt and static_throughput_5.txt,  the numbers are
in bytes.

shuttle.txt, static.txt and walking.txt have all the sensor readings
that we may use later.

## 1. parser

## 2. predictor
(may need to change raw data directory)
perl predict_traffic.pl shuttle_throughput_5.txt EWMA 0.1
(or run batch script)
perl batch_predict_traffic.pl
